As an SIR investigation, students Nick Magerko and Jon Reynolds of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy are working with Jason Rock of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne to create a system that will produces high-quality 3D models. 

This repository serves as the most primary account of the investigation that we can provide. Naturally, the investigators' institution requires that written journals be utilized as a primary account for the investigation. Indeed, we have attempted to this by providing the weekly goals, results and logic that were part of improving the project in our journals each week. Nonetheless, we believe that reviewing the commits made by both investigators will provide a more thorough explanation of how the final program was created.

Notice: At the end of AY '14, this project will be discontinued.
